1.Password complexity directly impacts security by making it harder for attackers to crack credentials through common hacking methods..

2.Strong, complex passwords reduce vulnerability to brute force and dictionary attacks..

3.Longer passwords take more time to guess, especially with more character variations.

4.Mixing letters, numbers, and special characters increases randomness, making it difficult for automated tools to predict.

5.Avoiding common words or patterns prevents dictionary attacks and credential stuffing.

6.Using unique passwords per account stops hackers from exploiting one compromised password across multiple platforms.

In short, complexity strengthens defenses against password-cracking techniques, ensuring safer digital security.
